# CS231N_project

The repository contains deep learning codes to detect knee abnormalities in MRI series. The work is part of the MRNet competition. Specifically:

# Multi_MRNet:
AlexNet based architecture to process multiple series at the same time and output three labels, i.e. the general abnormality, anterior cruciate ligament tear and meniscal tear 

# CNN_LSTM
AlexNet+LSTM based architecture

# 3dcnn
3D CNN based architectur
